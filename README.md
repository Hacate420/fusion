An algorithm for polarization image fusion based on multi-scale transformation is provided.
It integrates polarization degree images, polarization angle images, and visible light images.
The fusion process includes two rounds of image enhancement, with the fusion being based on image brightness. 
This algorithm is capable of fusing source images with low signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in clear and visible fusion outcomes.
